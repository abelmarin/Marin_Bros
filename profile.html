      <p>Marin Brothers, Inc. is a family run company founded by Abel Marin in 2006.
        Abel is a professional carpenter with over twenty years experience. At the
        beginning of his career, he worked mostly in the residential construction
        industry. Soon, the quality and timeliness of his work, along with his
        down-to-earth nature and honesty, became well-known in the construction
        community. This gained him respect and recognition from top general contractors,
        inspiring him to move 100% into commercial construction with his own professional
        carpentry company, Marin Brothers, Inc.</p>
