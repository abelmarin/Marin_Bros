        <div class="card">
            <p>Marin Brothers, Inc. is a family run company founded by Abel Marin in 2006. Abel is a professional
                carpenter with over twenty years experience. At the beginning of his career, he worked mostly in the
                residential construction industry. Soon, the quality and timeliness of his work, along with his
                down-to-earth nature and honesty, became well-known in the construction community. This gained him
                respect and recognition from top general contractors, inspiring him to move 100% into commercial
                construction with his own professional carpentry company, Marin Brothers, Inc.</p>
